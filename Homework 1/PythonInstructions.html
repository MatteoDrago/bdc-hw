  		<h1>Instruction for using Apache Spark with Python</h1>
		<h3>Windows</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>First of all you need to install&nbsp;<strong>Python&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Spark&nbsp;</strong>on your computer. In order to install Spark, follow the instructions on&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-spark-on-windows-pyspark-4498a5d8d66c">this</a>&nbsp;link, while for a good configuration of Python use the following;</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Download</a> and install Anaconda (select the version of Python that you prefer): this is a package which comes with the most useful modules that you will need for your scripts. Moreover, this will automatically install on your PC Jupyter Notebook, which is another user friendly IDE to run Python Scripts.</li>
		<li>After that, you need to open an Anaconda Prompt on the folder where you want to save your scripts. To install <strong>pyspark</strong><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>you have two options: either you create a dedicated environment inside Anaconda, which will be the only place where you can use&nbsp;<strong>pyspark,&nbsp;</strong>or you install it globally. The latter option is the most simple and is done by typing on the Anaconda Prompt simply:&nbsp;<br /><br /><em><strong>pip install pyspark</strong> <br /><br /></em>We refer to the Ananconda <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html">documentation</a> for all the steps to create dedicated environments.</li>
		<li>Last step consist of importing the modules that you need on your script using the instruction&nbsp;<em><br /><br /></em><em><strong>from pyspark import [...]</strong><br /><br /></em>and this works both in a jupyter notebook and in common .py file. Be aware that you need to run your .py script from the anaconda prompt if you haven't choose anaconda as you're default python interpreter.</li>
